What are the  Benefits of Using meta tags?
=>Meta tags provide several benefits for both search engines and users. 
Here are some of the key benefits:

1. Improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
    *Enhanced Search Engine Rankings: Properly used meta tags, especially the title and meta description tags, help search engines understand the content of a page, potentially leading to better rankings in search results.
    *Relevant Keywords: Although not as crucial as they once were, meta keywords tags can still provide context for search engines about the relevant keywords associated with a page.

2. Increased Click-Through Rates (CTR):
    *Compelling Descriptions: A well-crafted meta description can serve as an advertisement for your page in search engine results, enticing users to click on your link.
    *Accurate Titles: The title tag, which appears as the clickable headline in search results, can significantly impact the likelihood of users clicking through to your site.

3. Better User Experience:
    *Relevant Information: Meta tags provide users with a quick overview of the page's content before they visit, ensuring they find what they are looking for.
    *Browser Display: The title tag appears in the browser tab, helping users keep track of multiple open pages.

4. Social Media Sharing:
    *Open Graph and Twitter Cards: Meta tags like og:title, og:description, and og:image (for Open Graph) or twitter:title, twitter:description, and twitter:image (for Twitter Cards) optimize how content is displayed when shared on social media platforms.

5. Control Over Indexing and Crawling:
    *Robots Meta Tag: The robots meta tag can instruct search engines on whether to index a page and follow its links, giving webmasters control over how their pages are treated by search engine crawlers.
